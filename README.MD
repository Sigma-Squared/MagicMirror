# MagicMirror üß≠‚ú®

**MagicMirror** aims to add an adventure-friendly recovery mechanic to minecraft, similar to the [Magic Mirror](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Mirrors) in Terraria. It uses the underutilized **Recovery Compass**, with added particle and sound effects!

## üí° How to use
Get yourself a **recovery compass**, and right click anywhere. It will start a countdown, then teleport you back to your `/sethome`, player spawn, or world spawn; whichever is available first.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Zero configuration** - even by players. Works out of the box. Players without a set home will be warped to their respawn point or world spawn, whichever has been set.
- **Survival-focused** - prevent players from abusing teleportation using windup.
- **Immersive** - particle and sound effects.
- **Flexible** - `/sethome` command for players to set their respawn location to any location. The `item-name` setting allows you to make it such that only specifically named recovery compasses can act as magic mirrors.
- **Anti-suffocation** - checks players `/sethome` homes are free before they are teleported.
- **Configurable** - most features can be turned off.
- **Performant** - simple, optimized, doesn't do anything it doesn't need to.
